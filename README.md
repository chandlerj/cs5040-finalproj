# Deliverables

- Effective Visualizations of the Saffman-Taylor Instability facilitated by the IEEE SciVis 2016 contest dataset
- Interactive controls to manipulate the visualization to show different properties of the dataset/different facets of the Saffman-Taylor Instability
- A portable program which can be on any compatible system assuming the required dataset is supplied

# Dataset
The entire dataset (400+gb) can be obtained from [The San Diego Supercomputing Center](https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_sciviscontest/2016/README.html). We also offer a subset of the dataset (5gb) available via [USU Box](https://usu.box.com/s/spgzms9nc8fen8mdbf9fnq5pt9hvzy10)

# Installation and setup

0. Download the Dataset from the USU Box mentioned above. Extract the desired run of the simulation into the `data/run01/` directory and bulk rename the `.vtu` files to the format `run_n.vtu`.

1. Set up conda envrionment with Trame and Paraview. The environment can be created and activated with the following commands
    ```
    conda create -n pv-env -c conda-forge paraview trame trame-vtk trame-vuetify
    conda activate pv-env
    ```
2. Perform the clustering algorithm to create the version of the dataset needed for clustering using the `DBSCAN` script

    `python utils/DBSCAN.py data/run01 data/run01_DBSCAN`

3. At this point, you should be ready to run the trame app.

    `python main.py`

# Other Visualizations and Demonstration Video

We also have some additional topological analysis of this dataset available in the `ms_[20, 30, 40, 50,59].pvsm` state files. These files can be loaded inside of paraview **after** loading the `TopologyToolKit` plugin within Paraview (Tools => Manage Plugins => Select `TopologyToolKit` => Press load selected). These give a topological breakdown using critical point analysis of the data at select time steps. 

Beyond this, we also have completed renderings and a demonstration video available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I6ZTTRxMr5zN_VCXP5TDaXQaIwF4SmmD). Our demo video can be accessed directly [from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TOYlnjXc1mQLMPYSBpkTsFqcUSFeT2C8/view?usp=sharing).
